PROJECT OVERVIEW
In this project, we aim to analyze and visualize trends in data science salaries across various dimensions such as job roles, experience levels, company sizes, geographic locations, and time periods. By leveraging data from reputable sources and employing advanced Excel techniques, including pivot tables, charts, and slicers, we will create an interactive dashboard to provide insights into the factors influencing data science salaries.

Project Objectives:

Collect and preprocess data: Gather reliable data on data science salaries from reputable sources or surveys. Clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Perform exploratory data analysis: Explore the dataset to understand the distribution and characteristics of data science salaries across different dimensions.
Create pivot tables and charts: Utilize Excel's pivot table feature to aggregate and summarize salary data based on job roles, experience levels, company sizes, geographic locations, and years. Create corresponding charts to visualize the insights.
Implement slicers for interactivity: Enhance the dashboard's usability by incorporating slicers, allowing users to filter and drill down into specific subsets of the data.
Analyze trends and patterns: Analyze the visualizations to identify trends, patterns, and correlations in data science salaries. Explore questions such as:
How do salaries vary across different job roles?
What is the impact of experience level on salary?
Are there noticeable differences in salaries based on company size?
How do salaries compare across different countries?
What are the salary trends over the years?
Draw insights and conclusions: Draw meaningful insights from the analysis to understand the factors influencing data science salaries. Provide recommendations for job seekers, employers, and policymakers based on the findings.
